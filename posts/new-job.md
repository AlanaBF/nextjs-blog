I've secured my first job in tech! Woohoo ðŸ¥³ðŸ¤©ðŸ¥° It has been an exhilarating journey since I left my teaching career and embarked on a thrilling path of upskilling and retraining for a career change into the world of Tech. Breaking into this sector during a time of layoffs and fierce competition from established developers has been challenging, but I have gone above and beyond to ensure my success.

Thank you to Version 1 for this awesome opportunity as I embark on my career as an Associate Consultant on their Accelerate Digital Academy. I can't wait to get started. I begin my journey with 12 weeks of training followed by 18 months assigned to a Version 1 Team. My first week starts on the 10th July 2023 with 2 company days at the Redditch Office.

### 1. Embracing the Challenge

Leaving behind a comfortable teaching career and stepping into the unfamiliar territory of the tech industry was undoubtedly a daunting decision. However, I recognized the challenges and decided to face them head-on. The competitive job market didn't deter me; instead, it fueled my determination to make a mark in the tech world.

### 2. Investing in Myself

To give myself the best chance of success, I understood the importance of acquiring relevant skills and certifications. I enrolled in a government-funded Skills For Life bootcamp in Front End Web Development, which provided me with a solid foundation in this field. Additionally, I completed certifications in Prince2 Project Management and AgilePM, expanding my skill set and making myself more versatile.

### 3. Going the Extra Mile

Building my resume and practical experience was crucial. To showcase my abilities, I took the initiative to build a website for a local business, *[Kernow Pets](https://www.kernowpets.com)*, on a voluntary basis. This hands-on experience not only allowed me to apply my newly acquired skills but also added tangible value to my portfolio.

### 4. Networking and Seeking Advice

Recognizing the importance of industry connections and expert guidance, I actively sought opportunities to network with professionals in the tech field. I attended industry events, presented my projects to experts, and engaged with experienced individuals who provided invaluable insights and advice for success. Learning from those who have already walked the path was instrumental in shaping my approach.

### 5. A Desire to Learn and Improve

Having spent two decades teaching students, I now find myself on the other side of the learning journey. The eagerness to continuously learn and grow is a driving force behind my decision to transition into tech. I embrace the opportunity to practice and improve my skills, knowing that this industry thrives on innovation and adaptability.

## So excited for the future

Transitioning from a teaching career to the world of tech has been a transformative experience. Despite the challenges and competitive landscape, I have remained dedicated, committed, and hungry for success. This new chapter allows me to practice what I have been preaching to my students for the past 20 years. With my first job secured, I am thrilled to embark on this exciting career path and look forward to the endless possibilities that lie ahead.
