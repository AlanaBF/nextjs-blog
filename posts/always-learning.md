Always Learning! I suppose as a teacher I have always tried to share my passion for learning through the lessons I teach. Now as I embark on a career change journey I am actively demonstrating my own passion for learning.

Throughout my career I have always tried to further myself and learn new things. I love it, but I have never come across anything yet that has gripped me as much as Web Development has. I want to do it all the time, genuinely love it, and when I'm not learning new skills through a course, I'm trying to put what I've learnt into practice or coming up with ideas. It's become a bit of an obsession!

The prospect of not having a job is a big worry though. With a mortgage to pay and the tech job market being so overwhelmed at the moment with people like me looking for work, I am trying to upskill whilst also looking at a backup plan.

So what am I currently learning?

Well...

I am currently completing a 4 day course run by *[Kick Off in Business](https://www.kickoffinbusiness.co.uk/)*, which is a funded course.

This will give me two SFEDI Level 1 qualifications:
- Level 1 Award in Understanding Enterprise
- Level 1 Extended Award in Passport to Enterprise and Employment

I am looking at the option of being a freelance Web Developer and Maths Tutor whilst I look for a permanent job.

I am also continuing to develop my Web Development Knowledge and so I am working my way through an Udemy Course: The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp by Dr Angela Yu

- *Become a Full-Stack Web Developer with just ONE course.*

- *HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, React, MongoDB, Web3 and DApps*

I am particularly enjoying learning more about the backend side of coding with Node.js, Express and most recently about templating with EJS. There are so many different ways to achieve a similar result. It's a fascinating new world...

With learning new and complex content one thing I have learnt is that repetition is key so I try where I can in all the excitement of wanting to learn as much as I can to revise content by a process of space repetition:

- This involves learning the content
- Revise it within 24 hours
- Then revise again 3 days later
- Then revise again 7 days later
- Gradually increasing the time between each revision until it is committed to long term memory.

I'm also learning that there is so much to learn that you don't have to remember it all as that is what the documentation is for... and Google!
