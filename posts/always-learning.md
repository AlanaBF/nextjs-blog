As a teacher, I have always strived to share my passion for learning through the lessons I teach. Now, as I embark on a career change journey, I am actively demonstrating my own enthusiasm for continuous learning.

Throughout my career, I have consistently sought personal growth and embraced new knowledge. However, I have never encountered anything that has captivated me as much as web development. It has become a genuine love, occupying my time and thoughts. I'm constantly learning new skills through courses, applying what I've learned, and generating ideas. It has truly become an obsession!

While the prospect of being without a job is concerning, especially with financial commitments like a mortgage, I am taking steps to upskill while exploring backup plans.

So, what am I currently learning?

- I am in the process of completing a 4-day course offered by *[Kick Off in Business](https://www.kickoffinbusiness.co.uk/)*, which is a funded course. Upon completion, I will receive two SFEDI Level 1 qualifications:
  - Level 1 Award in Understanding Enterprise
  - Level 1 Extended Award in Passport to Enterprise and Employment

- Additionally, I am deepening my web development knowledge by working through the Udemy course titled "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu. This comprehensive course covers topics ranging from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to Node.js, React, MongoDB, Web3, and DApps. It provides a solid foundation for becoming a full-stack web developer.

I find particular joy in exploring the backend side of coding, including Node.js, Express, and recently, templating with EJS. It's fascinating to discover the multitude of approaches to achieve similar results. The world of web development is an ever-evolving and captivating realm.

When it comes to learning complex content, I have discovered that repetition is key. To solidify my understanding, I employ a spaced repetition process:
- Learn the content.
- Revise it within 24 hours.
- Review it again after 3 days.
- Repeat the revision after 7 days.
- Gradually increase the time between each revision until the knowledge is firmly embedded in long-term memory.

Furthermore, I am embracing the realization that there is an abundance of information to absorb, and I don't need to memorize everything. Documentation and resources like Google are invaluable tools in the learning process.

In this journey of constant learning and growth, I am excited to discover new horizons and push the boundaries of my skills.
