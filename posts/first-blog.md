Welcome to my blog! Here, I will document my journey as I transition from teaching to becoming a Front End Web Developer in the exciting world of technology.

For the past 20 years, I have had the privilege of being a teacher, experiencing the highs and lows that come with the profession. I am incredibly grateful for the opportunities I've had, including building a school farm, introducing an Animal Care BTEC program, and managing the Duke of Edinburgh Award. I've also had the chance to work in a British school in Spain and as a Sports Coach, Teacher, and House Parent in a boarding school. Throughout my teaching career, I have taught subjects like Maths, PE, Geography, and various other subjects as required. It has been a highly successful and enjoyable journey.

While I feel a sense of sadness leaving teaching, I believe it's the right time to pursue something for myself. This marks the first time I am venturing outside of the school environment at the age of 41!

I am filled with excitement as I embark on this new chapter. Recently, I completed a 16-week intensive bootcamp in Front End Web Development, which I discovered on the Government's Skills for Life website. I had the privilege of learning from a fabulous and inspiring instructional team. I am grateful to EdX for providing this opportunity. I'm also thrilled to continue coding and stay in touch with the team members I collaborated with on my projects.

As I now search for my first job in the Tech industry, I am aware that the journey ahead will be challenging. However, I am eager to embrace this new path and see where it leads me.

Life offers us one chance, and we never know what awaits us around the corner...

So here's to the first page in my new chapter.
