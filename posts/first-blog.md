Welcome to my blog site where I am going to try and share my journey as I leave Teaching and and try and make my way into the Tech world as a Front End Web Developer!

It's been the most amazing 20 teaching years of highs and lows and everything between. I consider myself thoroughly lucky to have been given the opportunities I have had. In particular, with my latest role where I have built a school farm, introduced an Animal Care BTEC and introduced and Managed the Duke of Edinburgh Award, but also to have had the opportunity to live in Spain and work in a British School there and to live and work in a boarding school as a Sports Coach, Teacher and House Parent. I've taught, Maths, PE and Geography and a whole host of other subjects as required. Overall a highly successful and enjoyable teaching career

Whilst I am sad to be leaving, with the education sustem as it is, I feel it is the right time to leave teaching and finally do something for me... This is the first time I have actually left school... ever ... and I'm 41!!!

I'm so excited to get started and see where my journey takes me. Ive just completed an intensive 16 week bootcamp in Front End Web Development which I stumbled across on the Governments Skills for Life website and worked with the most fabulous and inspiring instruction team. EdX, I am very grateful for the opportunity. I'm also thrilled to keep in contact and continue to code with the team members I completed my two projects with.

As I try now to find my first job in the Tech industry I know its going to be a tough journey but am so excited to see where this new path takes me.

We have one chance at life and you never know what's around the corner...

So...
