Embarking on a career change often triggers deep reflection. In my first week at the West Midlands Digital Skills Academy with Version1, we were challenged to reflect and create goals, nurturing a growth mindset. These reflections took me back to my childhood, shaped by my parents' involvement in the Royal Air Force (RAF) and my love for the Mallory Towers books by Enid Blyton. Those books ignited a desire to attend boarding school, a place where routine, structure, and freedom intertwined seamlessly. With my parents' support and RAF subsidies, I embarked on an incredible adventure that left an indelible mark on my life.

The boarding school experience not only provided structure and routine but also offered the freedom to express myself and be accepted for who I was. From making our beds to performing daily tasks, such as being a stable hand or managing the boys' yard (girls included), we learned responsibility. In my time, we had no central heating and when there was a powercut we rode it out! I learnt to be resilient and embrace  everything. Ponies added an extra touch of enchantment, allowing us to ride them barebackâ€”a thrilling and less regulated time when health and safety took a backseat.

Beyond the daily routines, our boarding school nurtured a love for learning, sports, and personal development. The school's emphasis on soft skills and character-building activities left an enduring impact. We engaged in daily silent reading sessions, learned to play musical instruments, devoured approved storybooks and fostered a love for literature. Moreover, we were encouraged to master public speaking through activities such as the English Speaking Board (ESB) sessions and orations competitions. I chose to spend 2 weeks of my summer holidays with the school learning to sail, camping with trickling cold water from a hose the farmer ran to the field. Character building! Though initially daunting, these experiences equipped me with valuable communication skills that would prove invaluable in my later years, including a successful 20-year teaching career. Sadly the boarding school has now closed but my memories remain, I keep in regular contact with many of the family and students and I'm glad I was able to visit with my wife before it closed its doors.

Reflecting on my journey, it becomes evident that schools should place less emphasis on grades and more on cultivating essential soft skills. The ability to communicate effectively, think critically, and adapt to new situations holds greater significance in our lives than the grades we achieve. My own experiences in boarding school and later as a teacher have taught me the value of these skills, and I believe that fostering them in students can have a transformative impact on their lives.

While my boarding school years were filled with cherished memories, life took some challenging turns once I left that nurturing environment. I faced bullying and struggled to come to terms with my sexuality. It took time and personal growth to embrace my identity fully. However, I never lost sight of my dreams and continued to seek new adventures. I became a house parent, teacher and sports coach in a boarding school in the New Forest, allowing me to travel extensively during breaks, with Australia and Canada becoming some of my favourite destinations. Towards the end of this role I was lucky enough to spend my holidays in the Seychelles. I met some amazing people and had some incredible experiences. When I reflect on my time in the Seychelles, I am filled with deep gratitude for these experiences that have shaped my perspective. The unparalleled beauty of those islands ignited a profound desire within me to set ambitious goals for my future. Among those aspirations will be the acquisition of a luxury motor yacht. My determination to turn this dream into reality is unwavering, and Iâ€™m sure that one day it will materialise.

Following my unforgettable Seychelles adventure, my journey led me to Spain, where I embarked on an entirely new chapter of my life. Stepping far beyond the boundaries of my comfort zone, I embraced the challenge of navigating unfamiliar roads, adapting to driving on the opposite side, and embarking on an extraordinary three-day solo car journey every holiday to return home. Upon arrival I discovered my accommodation was not yet ready, and I found myself spending my first two weeks in the unexpected company of nuns. My first challenge was convincing them that I didn't eat meat, only fish. The language barrier was a struggle. I failed. 'Jamon' apparently is ok for vegetarians! My up bringing made it very difficult to argue with a nun ðŸ˜‚. Although unconventional, these experiences played an integral role in an incredible adventure that not only restored my confidence but also reignited my desire to date again.

It was during this transformative phase of self-discovery that destiny intervened, and I crossed paths with the person who would become my wife. Together, we continue to embark on remarkable adventures, supporting and inspiring one another every step of the way.

My journey has been a tapestry of diverse experiences, career changes, and personal growth. From teaching mathematics to leading probation groups and managing community payback programs, to fostering children, I continually pushed my boundaries. Settling in Cornwall, I had the opportunity to introduce a school farm, develop an animal care program, and spearhead the Duke of Edinburgh award initiative. It enabled me to write an article on â€˜Why Every School Should have a Farmâ€™ and really try to inspire, share and give as many soft skills and values as I was lucky enough to have in my childhood.

My discovery of web development has fuelled my hunger for greater achievements. Iâ€™m raising the bar and have set my sights on bigger and better goals than ever before. My journey has been marked by resilience, self-discovery, and an unwavering pursuit of dreams. As I embark on my career change, Iâ€™m ready to embrace the next chapter of my life's adventures with Version 1.

Life's most extraordinary moments often arise from the depths of uncertainty, and I'm ready to navigate uncharted waters, both literally and figuratively, in pursuit of grander aspirations.

Join me as I continue this journey of reflection, growth, and setting ambitious goals. Dare to dream big!
